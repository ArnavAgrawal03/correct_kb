If it rains, the ground will be wet. If the ground is wet, people will avoid walking on the grass. However, if it does not rain, the ground may still be wet due to someone watering the plants. If someone waters the plants, then the flowers will bloom. If the flowers bloom and it is sunny, then the park will be filled with visitors. However, if the flowers do not bloom, the park will be empty unless there is a special event. If there is a special event, the park will have many people regardless of the weather. If it is both sunny and there is a special event, then the park will be crowded. But if it is neither sunny nor a special event, the park will be quiet.
